# Milestone 2 Reflection

Here are what we have implemented so far:

## User Filter Sidebar

TO BE FILLED BY FRANKLIN

## Summary Cards

TO BE FILLED BY TIEN

## Visualization Board

The four charts that were implemented:

- Emergency Response Time box plot
- Accident Count by Weather Conditions
- Accident Count by Age Groups
- Accident Count by Year

Note that we have also implemented categories to group these charts, either by "Accident Severity" or by "Time of Accident". Since the number of rows of the dataframe is approximately only 10,000 rows, our app was able to be relatively performant. These charts were implemented exactly the same as our proposed Milestone 1 sketch. No deviations from the proposal was made!

Low Hanging Fruit: We added tooltips to each charts so that when user hovers over the charts, additional information can be provided!

Limitaton: When working on the data with no filters applied yet, there seem to be no visible trend in any of the charts. However, once some user filters are applied (through the UI), then some notable and visible trends can be seen.

## NavBar (CHALLENGING section)

We also implemented the navbar with GitHub and About buttons. The GitHub buttons will take the user to the GitHub repository while the About buttons will render an additional About section in the navbar that explains what the project is, who the target audience is, main contributors as well as the date of the last deployment.
