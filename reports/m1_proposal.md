# Proposal

## Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data analysts specializing in transportation safety being hired by the Canadian government

Target audience: Canadian government transportation agencies and urban planners

Road accidents are a major public safety concern, leading to significant loss of life, economic costs, and infrastructural damage. Understanding the factors contributing to accidents—such as weather conditions, vehicle types, and driver behaviors—can help policymakers and city planners design safer road systems. To address this issue, we propose building an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore Canadian road accident trends, analyze accident severity across different regions, and identify key risk factors. By providing visual insights and filtering capabilities, our dashboard will help decision-makers implement targeted interventions to improve road safety.
