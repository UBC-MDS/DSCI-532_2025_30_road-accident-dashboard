# DSCI 532 - Group 30: Road Accident

## Our Motivation and Purpose  

Road accidents are a major public safety concern, leading to significant loss of life, economic costs, and infrastructural damage. Understanding the factors contributing to accidents—such as weather conditions, vehicle types, and driver behaviors—can help policymakers and city planners design safer road systems. This dashboard provides interactive visualizations to explore Canadian accident trends, analyze accident severity across different regions, and identify key risk factors. By offering data-driven insights, it helps decision-makers implement targeted interventions to improve road safety.  

## Who are we?  

We are data analysts specializing in transportation safety. Our goal is to help the Canadian government transportation agencies and urban planners leverage data to make informed decisions that enhance road safety.  

## Dataset Attribution

This project uses data from the [Global Road Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday1/global-road-accidents-dataset) available on Kaggle.  

## Usage  

- Use the **region selector** to explore accident trends across different locations.  
- Filter by **weather conditions, vehicle types, or driver characteristics** to identify key risk factors.  
- Analyze **accident severity distributions** to understand patterns and potential causes.  
- Compare trends over time using the **date range filter**.  

The interactive visualizations update based on user inputs, providing actionable insights for policy improvements.
